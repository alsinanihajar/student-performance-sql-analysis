# student-performance-sql-analysis

## Project Description
How can students improve their exam performance?

In this project, I analyze student performance data using **SQL**.  
The dataset includes information about study habits, sleep patterns, and extracurricular activities.

The goal of this project is to apply **data manipulation techniques in SQL** to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on exam scores.

## Key Questions
- Which factors are most associated with high exam scores?
- Do students who participate in extracurricular activities perform better?
- Is there an optimal range of study hours for better performance?
- How can ranking be used to evaluate performance while preserving privacy?

---

## Key Insights
- Students who study more than 10 hours per week and participate in extracurricular activities tend to achieve higher exam scores.
- The best exam performance is observed among students studying between 11 and 16 hours per week.
- Student ranking is used instead of raw exam scores to compare performance without exposing individual results.
